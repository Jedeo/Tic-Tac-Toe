## Introduction
  -I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this project to create a simple tic-tac-toe game. For JavaScript, I used three classes: Player, Board, and Game classes. Within those classes, I created some methods that helped update the data model. I used the Query Selectors to update the DOM with the data model.
